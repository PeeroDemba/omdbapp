# OMDB APP

## ABOUT

This application utilizes the OMDB API to display various movies searched for by its user. It also enables its user to bookmark and unbookmark movies. It has two (2) sections named Movies and Bookmarks.

The Movies section has a search input that allows users to search for any kind of movies. Each movie also has a bookmark and unbookmark button for bookmarking and unbookmarking each movie.

The Bookmarks section contains a list of all movies the user has bookmarked. Each bookmarked movie also has unbookmark buttons for easier unbookmarking of already bookmarked movies.

## SET UP AND RUN APPLICATION

- Pull code from this repository to your local machine.
- Open the pulled folder in an IDE.
- Build project (Type "npm run build" into the terminal in the project folder and click "Enter")
- Upload dist folder located in the project folder to a hosting platform like Netlify or Vercel.

## KEY DECISIONS

- Usage of local storage to get the list of bookmarked movies as Context API doesn't persist data after page reloads.
- Text to label bookmark and unbookmark buttons instead of icons.
